# 📸 Instagram Frontend Static Clone

A static clone of the Instagram UI built using **React**. This project focuses on applying **core React concepts** such as component-based architecture, props, state management, and data fetching from a local JSON Server. UI components are styled using **React Bootstrap**.

> 🚫 This is a frontend-only project with no real backend or authentication logic. All data is served from a mock API using `db.json`.
